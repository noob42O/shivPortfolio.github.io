  <td rowspan="2">Jpeg</td>
  <td rowspan="2"> Jpg was a filetype developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) to be a standard for professional photographers. Like the method ZIP files use to find redundancies in files to compress data, JPGs compress image data by reducing sections of images to blocks of pixels or “tiles.” JPG compression has the unfortunate side effect of being permanent, however, as the technology for the file was created for storing large photographic image files in surprisingly small spaces, and not for photo editing.JPGs have become the de facto standard image of the internet because they can be compressed so much However, because of the lossy nature of JPG, it is not an ideal way to store art files. Even the highest quality setting for JPG is compressed, and will change the look of your image, if only slightly</td> </td>
  <td rowspan="2"> All RGB JPG files are 24 bits), the uncompressed image size when opened in memory is always 3 bytes per pixel. </td>

  <td rowspan="2"> png </td>
  <td rowspan="2"> NG stands for Portable Network Graphics (or, depending on whom you ask, the recursive “PNG-Not-GIF”). It was developed as an open alternative to GIF,PNG supports 8-bit color like GIF, but also supports 24-bit color RGB, like JPG does. They are also non-lossy files, compressing photographic images without degrading image quality. PNG tends to be the biggest of the three filetypes and isn’t supported by some (usually older) browsers.</td>
  <td rowspan="2"> The full-size PNG has a file size of 402KB, but the full-sized, compressed JPEG is only 35.7KB</td>

  <td rowspan="2"> Gif  </td>
  <td rowspan="2">  GIF stands for “Graphics Interchange Format” GIF is by nature an 8-bit color file, meaning they are limited to a palette of 256 colors,Because of this non-lossy format, GIF can be used to keep tight lines on typography and geometric shapes, although these things are better suited to vector graphic files like SVG or the Adobe Illustrator native format, AI. </td>
  <td rowspan="2"> . While this limited palette keeps down file size and is perfectly acceptable for on-screen viewing, it leads to posterized images when they are printed. It can also be called alive image for someone not fimilar with technology </td>
